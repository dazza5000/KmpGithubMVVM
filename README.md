* Implements Android and iOS targets
* Uses MVVM Design pattern (Lifecycle arch component and LiveData on Android, SwiftUI and Combine on iOS)
* Uses [SqlDelight](https://github.com/cashapp/sqldelight) library for local data persistence for both Android and iOS
* Uses Cocoapods plugin for building iOS targets. For cocoapods setup instructions, see [this readme](https://github.com/jshvarts/KmpGithub)
